What's the Difference Between CBG and CBD
What's the Difference Between CBG and CBDCBG vs. CBD: What's the Difference? Cannabinoids include CBD, THC, CBG, and over 120 other lesser-known chemicals that naturally occur in the cannabis plant. Some strains have been specially cultivated to include more CBG, but CBG is largely derived from younger cannabis plants that have not yet converted CBG into CBD and THC. Although both compounds are non-intoxicating cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, CBG and CBD have a few notable differences. Broad-spectrum CBD oils contain all the cannabinoids found in a cannabis plant, including CBD, but it doesn't include THC.
